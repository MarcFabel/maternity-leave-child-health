		\scriptsize{\emph{Notes:} The figure depicts the evolution of key variables for the treatment and control cohort (only pre-threshold months, i.e. for individuals born between November 1977 and April 1978 as well as November 1978 and April 1979, respectively) over the ages from 17 to 35. The dark lines correspond to the treatment cohorts, whereas control units are marked by light dashed lines. Hospital admissions are defined as the sum of all diagnosis chapters listed in Panel A of Table \ref{tab_mlch:outcomes_coding_main_chapters}. %The x-axis shows in addition to the year the age of the treatment cohort in brackets.
