			\emph{Notes:} The figures plot intention-to-treat estimates (along with 90\%/95\% confidence intervals) across the main diagnosis chapters. Furthermore, they indicate how often each chapter is diagnosed over the entire time frame (1995-2014). The outcomes are defined as the number of cases per 1,000 individuals. The point estimates are coming from a DiD regression as described in section \ref{sec_mlch:empirical_strategy}, with a bandwidth of six months, month-of-birth and year fixed effects, and clustered standard errors on the month-of-birth level. The control group is comprised of children that are born in the same months but one year before the reform (i.e. children born between November 1977 and October 1978). \newline
			\emph{Legend:} Infectious and parasitic diseases (IPD), neoplasms (Neo), mental and behavioral disorders (MBD), diseases of the nervous system (Ner), diseases of the sense organs (Sen), diseases of the circulatory system (Cir), diseases of the respiratory system (Res), diseases of the digestive system (Dig), diseases of the skin and subcutaneous tissue (SST), diseases of the musculoskeletal system (Mus), diseases of the genitourinary system (Gen), symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions (Sym), injury, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes (Ext).
