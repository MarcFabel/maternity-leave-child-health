

Given the complicated PISA regression procedure, the regression output cannot be exported using
a Stata command that does the formatting automatically. 

Briefly, this is how the output contained in the table "results.xls" should be read: 

-the first three columns report the coefficients, the standard errors and the Pvalue for the regression
 of reading test scores

-the second three columns report the coefficients, the standard errors and the Pvalue for the regression
 of mathematics test scores

-rows "Medium","High", "year_2006", "Constant" indicate the coefficients of the regressions

-the row adjusted_R_squared reports the adjusted R squared for the regression of reading test scores (first column) 
  and for the regression of mathematics test scores (second column)

-the row "observations" reports the number of observations (students), which is the same for both regressions.
