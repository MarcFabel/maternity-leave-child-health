\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R1.1: Adjusting Nomenclature}
\begin{quote}
	\textit{R1.1: "Identification is based on a \underline{difference-in-difference} approach. While this is fine, I do not see many elements of a regression discontinuity design, as this is characterized by local estimation of treatment effects, kernel weighting and flexible controls for trends in the running variable on either side of the cutoff. Thus, the statement that it is a combination of a regression discontinuity design with a difference-in-difference approach is inappropriate. The author states that he compares health differentials between children born shortly before and after the reform with health differentials in the previous year. Given that the main regressions in the paper are based on a window of 12 months (6 months on either side of the cut-off), the term “shortly” is misleading."}
\end{quote}
\underline{Response:} I agree that the claim of `a combination of a regression discontinuity design with a difference-in-differences approach' may entertain wrong expectations. For this reason, I have dropped this statement and label my empirical approach as a difference-in-differences design (see page \pageref{rev_mlch: r1_rdd+did_intro} in the introduction and page \pageref{rev_mlch: r1_rdd+did_em_section} in the section on the empirical strategy). Related to this issue, I have also removed the term `shortly' and replaced it with `in the months' in these instances.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R1.2: Expansion of the Appendix}
\begin{quote}
	\textit{R1.2: "The author discusses potential \underline{threats to the validity} of the design in the Appendix. While the Appendix operates at a very close window around the cut-off (including at most 8 weeks (4 weeks at either side)), the main specification of the paper is based on a window of 12 months and some estimates are shown also for 10, 8 and 6 months. This is not coherent. I was surprised that the author uses a window of 12 months for the main specification. This is a large window and includes children born in all months of the year. I understand that this is an argument for the implementation of a difference-in-difference approach. However, it has nothing to do with the analysis given in the Appendix. I recommend expanding the Appendix by discussing also potential threats to the validity of the study design that \underline{occur not only at the threshold} but along the whole distribution of birth months (potential seasonal differences in socio-economic characteristics, potential biases resulting from relative age effects induced by school-entry rules). One important question is whether the parallel trends assumption holds."}
	
	\textit{"Related to this issue, I worry about \underline{school-entry rules} in Germany. The before-group was born between November and April, the post-group was born between May and October. As I understood correctly, in most German states the cut-off date for school entry is June 30. Thus, students born in May or June are the youngest in their cohort, while children born in July are the oldest. Relative age effects academic achievement (see for example Jürges/Schneider (2011): Why young boys stumble: Early tracking, age and gender bias in the German school system, German Economic Review 12 (4) 2011, 371-394). First, given the cut-off in school entry rules between June and July, I worry that potential unobserved differences between those students are not fully accounted for in the difference-in-difference estimations. This issue should be discussed in the paper in more detail and some robustness checks should be presented. For example, I would like to see results when the sample window is reduced to March - June only and I would like to see robustness checks with the additional control cohort (2 years prior to the reform) for various sampling windows. It is important to convince the reader that the reform effect is different from the usual differences between students born in different months of the year. I think more has to be done here."}
\end{quote}
\underline{Response:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item As suggested, I have expanded the Appendix such that it consists of two parts. The first part describes the threats at the threshold (self-selection due to postponed delivery or strategic conception). I have added the second part (section V.2 on page \pageref{rev_mlch:threats_birth_months}), which discusses threats along the distribution of birth months. The section contains a theoretical explanation of which threats are encountered in this context, a brief discussion on the parallel trends for the pre-threshold cohorts, and covers the two robustness checks suggested by you (see Figures \ref{fig_mlch: hospital2_school_cutoff} and \ref{fig_mlch: hospital2_addcg_bws_age-group_gender}). Both robustness checks, the exclusion of school entry discontinuities and using the additional control cohort for different bandwidths, yield similar estimates compared to the baseline specification. The similarity of the estimates suggests that season of birth effects (particularly school entry effects) do not pose a threat to the validity of the identification scheme.
	\item Regarding your second suggestion, using the additional control cohort for different bandwidths, I would like to mention an additional robustness check carried out in section \ref{sec_mlch: robustness}. In there, I discuss a potential violation of the stable unit treatment value assumption (due to spillover effects, please also see my response to the comment Ed.3). To rebut this concern, I use different birth cohorts as control group. The similarity of the estimates across specifications further supports the notion that treatment and control group share the same season of birth effects.
	\item The explanation about the parallel trends is relatively brief. I thought it best to add the information directly in the paper's results section (together with the life-course figures showing the yearly differentials). If you feel they belong in the Appendix, I can move them accordingly.
\end{itemize}

% Level of aggregation - estimates per reporting year

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R1.3: Level of Aggregation}
\begin{quote}
	\textit{R1.3: "The Difference-in-Difference estimates are based on \underline{aggregated data} by cohort x birth-month x reporting year. I worry that the number of observations is artificially blown up by the dimension of the reporting year (age). Are the estimates still significantly different from zero if only year x birth-month is used as level of aggregation (for a given reporting year)?"}
\end{quote}
\underline{Response:} The life-course Figures \ref{fig_mlch: lc_hospital2_frg_DD} and \ref{fig_mlch: lc_d5_frg_DD} (pages \pageref{fig_mlch: lc_hospital2_frg_DD} and \pageref{fig_mlch: lc_d5_frg_DD}) report estimates per reporting year in which each estimate comes from a regression with $N=24$. The estimates are significantly different from zero for older ages and, in particular, for men (for more details, please refer to corresponding sections). I have added a phrase in the Figures' footnotes to make it explicit that the estimates are on the level of birth-month$\times$year (i.e. per reporting year). I hope this makes the concept of the life-course graphs clearer. For your convenience, I enclose the corresponding Tables \ref{rev_mlch: lc_table_hospital} and \ref{rev_mlch: lc_table_d5} here in the reply.

% FRG, GRD - subgroup analysis

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsubsection}{R1.4: Subgroup Analysis}
\begin{quote}
	\textit{R1.4: "The author cannot distinguish children from mothers who were affected by the reform from children whose mothers who were not because e.g. they might have \underline{migrated} to West-Germany from either Eastern-Germany or other countries. A subgroup analysis of the ITT for regions with few and many migrants might be interesting and should yield stronger effects for regions without many migrants."}
\end{quote}
\underline{Response:}

As you rightfully point out, I cannot exclude children whose mothers were not affected by the 1979 ML reform (e.g. born in East-Germany or other countries). The infeasibility to separate unaffected from affected individuals merely attenuates my ITT estimates and does not pose a threat to the validity of the identification scheme (see section \ref{sec_mlch:data}, last paragraph).



Your suggestion is a great idea to check how large the dilution effects of non-treated children from East-Germany (GDR) and other countries are. The implementation, though, is rather difficult and will take considerable time. This is due to the fact that when using new data at the Research Data Center, I have to file for approval, which is always a protracted endeavor (we're speaking of months). 


Since the implementation challenges are considerable, I hereby address your concern by checking how large the potential dilution effects are likely to be and which kind of data I would need to implement the sample split you suggest. Let's go through the two cases separately. 

First, to capture the non-treated children from the GDR, I would need to construct yearly migration matrices since 1990 to have the local number of migrants from the GDR. Since this data is not publicly available, I checked whether the GDR migrants have a big enough impact to dilute the DiD estimates to a large extent. For that exercise, I use the 2014 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel and look at the birth cohort of 1979, which resides in the area of West-Germany. Table \ref{rev_mlch: fractions_gdr_foreigners} shows that only 7.6 percent of the 1979 birth cohort living in West-Germany are untreated GDR migrants, which suggests that the dilution effect on the obtained results might be negligible. 


% Table

	\begin{threeparttable} \centering \caption{Where did you live in 1989?}\label{rev_mlch: fractions_gdr_foreigners}
		\begin{tabular}{lr}
			\toprule
			Location & Fraction \\
			\midrule
			
			East Germany (GDR) incl. East Berlin & 7.58 \\
			West Germany (FRG) incl. West Berlin & 61.24 \\
			Abroad & 31.19 \\
			\midrule
			Total & 100.00 \\
			\bottomrule
		\end{tabular}
		\begin{tablenotes} 
			\item \scriptsize \emph{Notes:} The table shows weighted fractions for where respondents lived in 1989. The sample is restricted to individuals born in 1979 and reside in the area of former West-Germany in 2014 (N$=409$). The fractions are weighted with longitudinal individual survey weights.\newline \emph{Source: SOEP, Version 31, 2014, doi:10.5684/soep.v31}
		\end{tablenotes}
	\end{threeparttable}
\end{table}

Second, as shown in Table \ref{rev_mlch: fractions_gdr_foreigners}, the dilution effect of non-treated children from other countries is likely to be more important than the impact of GDR migrants. To capture the effect of this set of migrants, I could use publicly available proxies. For instance, the German Statistical Office provides population figures per nationality and age bracket. Using the number of foreigners to generate the sample split will have other challenges. One caveat is that working mothers with non-German nationalities were eligible for ML in 1979. 


Summing up, at the moment, I cannot present the desired sample split because of data issues. Considering the long time lag stemming from the institutional setup here in Germany, I am unsure whether the benefits of that sample split outweigh its costs. In the case of GDR migrants, their impact is too small to have a meaningful dilution effect. And in the case of migrants from other countries, the sample split according to the available data might be inappropriate.  

However, if you feel the paper should cover this sample split, I will gladly conduct it as suggested.
