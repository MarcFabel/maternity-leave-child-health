\section{Response Letter}

\vspace{5em}

Dear Professor Balsa, dear referees, 

Thank you very much for the detailed reading of my paper "Maternity Leave and Children's Health Outcomes in the Long-Term". Your thoughtful comments and constructive suggestions were very helpful and enhanced the quality of the paper considerably. 

Below is a summary of how I have revised the paper based on the comments made by you. I follow the sequence in which the issues were raised and include the respective comment (in italics and indented) before my response. Having the replies in the same document as the manuscript allows me to provide clickable cross-references to sections, figures, tables, and footnotes. For your information, any changes made in the manuscript since the original submission are highlighted in \revision{green}. 

I hope you like the revised version of the paper and look forward to hearing from you in due course. 

Kind regards,

Marc Fabel
