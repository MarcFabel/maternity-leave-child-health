\newpage
\textbf{First stage - effects of this particular reform in maternity leave}\newline 
%[XXX Ich habe jetzt pro Aspekt die beiden Zusammengeworfen und nicht jedes paper für sich behandelt, notwendig da SL zB mehr in die Tiefe geht bei maternal outcomes]
The effects of the 1979 maternity leave reform has been investigated by the three studies of \cite{Dustmann2012}, \cite{schonberg2014expansions}, and \cite{guertzgen2018}.\footnote{Both, \cite{Dustmann2012} and \cite{schonberg2014expansions} analyze the impact of the expansion in maternity leave on maternal labor market outcomes. While the former study augments this aspect by evaluating potential changes in child outcomes due to the reform, the latter study focuses on maternal labor market outcomes but elicits more in depth results.} The first two studies show that the reform had a large impact on mothers' short-run labor market outcomes. \newline First, many mothers strongly adjust their labor supply downwards during the four months of extra leave, and return to the labor market as soon as the leave period terminates. Yet, it seems that there is only a small effect on long-run maternal labor supply (i.e. for the time period beyond six months after childbirth). For instance, while the reform decreased the share of mothers who had returned to the labor market by the third month after childbirth by 30.5 percentage points, the reduction in the share of returned mothers by the 52nd/76th month after childbirth is only around one percentage point.\footnote{When looking at long-run maternal labor force participation rates (i.e. at the child's sixth birthday), one can see that the reform leads to a modest increase in the probability a mother is working. The implication is that the mothers who abstain from the labor market in the long-run, would have only returned to work temporarily in absence of the reform.}
In total, the change of postnatal maternity leave from two to six months caused mothers to postpone their return to work by, on average, 0.835 months.\footnote{This number corresponds to the number of months away from work in the first 40 months since childbirth.} Furthermore, approximately two-third of the decline in short-run female labor force participation is the result from a contraction in full-time work. Most of the mothers who postponed their labor market return, would have returned to their previous employers in absence of the reform. \newline
Second, the expansion in maternity leave lead to changes in mothers' income. When focusing on mere labor market income there is no effect of the reform that is significantly different from zero. However, when maternity benefit payments are included in the income measure for the eligible women, there is an overall increase in cumulative total income by, on average, 1,700 Deutschmarks (DM) as a result of the reform.\footnote{Maternal cumulative total  income is defined as the accumulated total income up to the point when the child is 40 years old. It consists of monthly earnings when the mother is working, equals to the benefits when she is on leave or is zero otherwise.\newline \cite{Dustmann2012} deflate monthly income such that everything is in 1992 prices. The benefit of 750 DM (1,190 DM in 1992 prices) resembles approximately one-third (55\%) of the mother's pre-birth (post-birth) earnings.} This is due to the fact that the effect of unexpected extra income for mothers who would have stayed at home even without the reform prevails over the decrease in available income stemming from the reduction in maternal employment. In contrast to the impact on labor supply, there is a strong effect heterogeneity in cumulative income across wages (an increase of 2,850 DM for mothers in the lowest tercile of the wage distribution, while the additional income amounts to 1,050 DM for women in the highest tercile). \newline
% vielleicht nochmal wrap up wie in der Discussion von SL, short-run effet on maternal employment yes - LR nichts verbessert, no depreciation of HC... 
Although there are strong effects on maternal labor market outcomes, in particular in the short-run, \cite{Dustmann2012} do not find evidence that the reform had an impact on children's educational attainment and labor market outcomes. They do not find any changes in the levels or years of education, log wages, or the share of individuals in full-time employment in response to the reform. 

% so strong effect on mother's return to work behavior given but so far in the domains that were looked at, there are no effects on children's long-run outcomes.

\cite{guertzgen2018} investigate the impact of the 1979 reform on mothers long-term ($>$ 6 weeks) sickness absence after childbirth. They find positive differentials for mothers who gave birth under the more generous maternity leave regime, in other words mothers who gave birth after the threshold exhibit more long-term sickness spells compared to mothers who gave birth before the cutoff date. For instance, post-reform mothers have a 3.1 percentage points higher probability of having ever experienced a long-term illness spell by the third year after childbirth. This result remains the same even after controlling for observable health differences. Furthermore, they suggest a selection story in which mothers with worse health status are more likely to return to the labor market and that this group is by a large extent driving the adverse health effects in response to the reform.\newline



\textbf{The effects of other reforms on health or where you find something in other LR domains (oder kommt die section besser in die Intro so wie in der MA?)} $\rightarrow$ {\color{red}combine with channels}
Even though there was no effect of this particular reform on children's long-term outcomes, there are examples which do find differentials in child outcomes.

\end{itemize}

% IDENTIFICATION
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Empirical strategy}\label{sec:empirical_strategy}
\subsection{Design}
In order to estimate the causal effect of maternity leave at the intensive margin, we exploit the 1979 reform's eligibility rule, which is contingent on childrens' birth date (see section \ref{sec:background}). Children born on/after a specified birth cutoff date (May 01, 1979) fall under the new regime with six months of maternity leave after childbirth, whereas children born before the threshold are exposed to two months. Assignment to treatment is a deterministic function of the birth date of the child and thus "sharp" as in the terminology of \cite{hahn2001identification}. A regression discontinuity design (RDD) might constitute a first potential identification strategy, in which one compares health outcomes of children which are quite similar with the only notable exception that their mothers were entitled to different lengths of maternity leave.\newline 
We augment this idea of a local identification by combining the RDD with a difference-in-differences (DD) approach. A large body of literature suggests that there is a strong relationship between season of birth, health and other socioeconomic outcomes. The seasonality may come about due to reasons that are associated with either pre- or postnatal factors. First, the seasonality might arise due to selective conception, i.e. the socioeconomic composition of mothers varies over time \citep{buckles2013season}. Second, \cite{currie2013within} argue that the issue of selection is not as large as previously thought and put forward the idea that any season of birth effects might be due to seasonal patterns of in-utero disease prevalence and nutrition.\footnote{In particular, they find seasonal influenza as a potential mechanism between month of birth and later outcomes.} Last, the seasonality aspect may also be the result of social postnatal factors such as age at school-entry \citep{black2011too}. \newline If one would not take these season-of-birth effects into consideration, it could be the case that the estimated effect is partly driven by the difference of health outcomes from that seasonality component and not due to the expansion in maternity leave coverage. Yet, by matching up the difference in health outcomes of children born within a distance to the birth cutoff date in which the legislation change took place (henceforth referred to as the treatment cohort) with differences in outcomes of children born around the same threshold one year prior the reform (control group) we can eliminate the seasonality component while preserving the local identification aspect.\footnote{In our widest specification we use a bandwidth of half a year on either side, i.e. the treatment groups consists of people that were born between November 1978 and October 1979.}
The implicit identifying assumption is that seasonality is time-invariant, in other words, one has to assume that the season-of-birth effects are the same for treatment and control group.\newline

Our main specification to estimating the effect of the length of maternity leave on children's health outcomes corresponds to the following equation: \footnote{The estimation procedure can also be found in similar contexts in \cite{RafaelLaliveandJosefZweimuller2009}, \cite{Dustmann2012}, \cite{Ekberg2013}, \cite{schonberg2014expansions}, \cite{Lalive2014}, \cite{Huebener2017}, \cite{danzer2017}, and \cite{guertzgen2018}.}
\begin{align}
Y_{mrt} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 Treat_{mr} + \gamma_2 After_{mr} + \gamma_3 Treat_{mr} * After_{mr} + \psi_m + \phi_r + \rho_t + \varepsilon_{mrt}
\end{align}
where $Y_{mrt}$ is the number of diagnoses per thousand individuals of the cohort born in month $m$, who reside in region $r$ at time period $t$. $Treat_{mr}$ is a dichotomous variable equal to one for groups that are born shortly before or after the legislation took place (i.e. the treatment cohort).\footnote{In the widest specification this involves children, who are born between November 1978 and October 1979, implying a bandwidth of half a year around the cutoff.} $After_{mr}$ is a dummy variable that equals to one if the individuals are born after the threshold month May (i.e. born in May-October in the widest specification, for both treatment and control cohort). $\psi_m$, $\phi_r$, $\rho_t$ are month-of-birth, region, and survey year fixed effects respectively. At first, $Y_{mrt}$ correspond to outcomes observed over the period 1995-2014. In section \ref{sec:results-lifecourse}, we apply a life-course approach by running the regression for each year individually.\footnote{text} 


The parameter of interest is $\gamma_3$ which captures the effect of the policy change on health outcomes. As we don't have any information on the fact whether the individuals' mothers were on leave, the identified parameter is an intention-to-treat effect. \newline
 %The interaction term $Treat_{mr} * After_{mr}$ equals one for the group of interest (the children born between May and October 1979,i.e. the post-reform children in the treatment group).


%control group
Unlike \cite{Dustmann2012} we only use the cohort born in the year prior to the reform as control group.\footnote{\cite{Dustmann2012} use in total three birth cohorts as control group, two cohorts before and one cohort after the treatment cohort: group 1 born 11/1976-10/1976; group 2 born 11/1977-10/1978; and group 3 born 11/1979-10/1980 compromise the control group. Our control cohort is identical to the one used by \cite{guertzgen2018}.} The more cohorts are used as potential control groups, the less likely it is that the identifying assumption is met. Additionally, taking a birth cohort in the year after the policy change as control group might invalidate the comparability between the treatment and control group as parents might have enough time to react to the reform and adjust fertility patterns. For these reasons, we have just the one cohort prior to the treatment cohort as control group in our main specifications and in the robustness section we show the results of estimations which are in line with the approach chosen by \cite{Dustmann2012}.\newline


%clustering
Standard errors are clustered on the interaction of birth month and state level in order to account for likely correlation of the error $\varepsilon_{mrt}$ over time for a given month of birth cohort and across cohorts for a given state.
%We use sandwiched standard error estimates
%, allowing errors to be correlated over time within a month-of-birth cohort, and across 
%Diagnosis rates are serially correlated, cluster on month-of-birth and state level.

	\item MZ (problem of selected sample, but large (enough?) number of obs) -> balancing table of parental predetermined covariates
	\item Fertility distribution  -> histograms

\textit{"The positive impact of breastfeeding on lowering the risk of death from infectious diseases in the first two years of life is now well-established (1). A mounting body of evidence suggests that breastfeeding may also play a role in programming noncommunicable disease risk later in life (2-13) including protection against overweight and obesity in childhood (2-6)."}

\textit{"The study showed that children who received breast milk for the first four months had a specific pattern of growth and metabolic profile that differed from the formula-fed babies. Even at 15 days of life, the breast-fed infants had blood insulin levels that were lower than the formula-fed infants.\newline
By 3 years of age, many of the metabolic and growth differences between the breast-fed and formula-fed infants had disappeared. However, blood pressure readings were higher in the infants who had been fed the high-protein formula compared with breast-fed infants. The blood pressure rates were still within the normal range."}
