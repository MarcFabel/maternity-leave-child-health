\textit{"The positive impact of breastfeeding on lowering the risk of death from infectious diseases in the first two years of life is now well-established (1). A mounting body of evidence suggests that breastfeeding may also play a role in programming noncommunicable disease risk later in life (2-13) including protection against overweight and obesity in childhood (2-6)."}

\textit{"The study showed that children who received breast milk for the first four months had a specific pattern of growth and metabolic profile that differed from the formula-fed babies. Even at 15 days of life, the breast-fed infants had blood insulin levels that were lower than the formula-fed infants.\newline
By 3 years of age, many of the metabolic and growth differences between the breast-fed and formula-fed infants had disappeared. However, blood pressure readings were higher in the infants who had been fed the high-protein formula compared with breast-fed infants. The blood pressure rates were still within the normal range."}
