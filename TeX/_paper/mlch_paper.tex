% Intro
Exciting intro to the topic...\newline

% reform, strategy 
This paper assesses the impact of the length of maternity leave on children’s long-run health outcomes. My quasi-experimental design evaluates an unexpected expansion in maternity leave coverage from two to six months, which occurred in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1979. The expansion came into effect after a sharp cutoff date and significantly increased the time working mothers stayed at home with their newborns during the first six months after childbirth. In order to estimate the causal effect of the length of maternity leave on child health outcomes I exploit the exogenous variation stemming from the reform, which provides a treatment assignment that is as good as random. Namely, all previously employed women, who gave birth on or after May 01, 1979, were eligible for six months of maternity leave after childbirth, whereas mothers, who delivered their baby before the cutoff date were entitled to two months of job-protected maternity leave. In order to eliminate potential season of birth effects, I combine a regression discontinuity design with a difference-in-differences approach: health outcomes of children, who were born shortly before and after the implementation of the policy reform, are compared to outcomes of children who are born in the same calendar months but in the previous year in which no legislative change took place.\newline


% data & findings
In the analysis, I exploit German hospital registry data, containing detailed information about the universe of inpatients' diagnoses for the years 1995 to 2014. By tracking the health of treated and control children from age 16 up to age 35, I find significant and robust evidence that the expansion in maternity leave improves children's health over the life-cycle. Children subject to the more generous leave scheme are on average 1.7 percent less likely to be hospitalized. The results are driven by fewer hospital admissions for men and are stronger for individuals in their late 20s and after. Furthermore, when investigating the components of hospitalizations, I see that the largest driver for the decline in hospital admissions is coming from mental and behavioral disorders (MBD) due to the use of psychoactive substances and fewer incidences of schizophrenia. Investigating other health outcomes, I see either positive (diseases of the respiratory and digestive system, and injuries) or null effects. \newline

% Back of the envelope calculations
The 1979 maternity leave expansion entails benefits, which were not primarily at the heart of policy makers when deciding on the legislation. Yet, back of the envelope calculations based on my estimates imply that the 'unintended' effects are substantial. For instance, the reform leads to an average reduction of 370 fewer diagnoses of MBD for one birth cohort per year. This translates into an average cost of 6.6 Mio Euro per birth cohort per annum (based on an estimated cost of 17,850 Euros per MBD diagnosis).\footnote{The estimated social cost of 17,850 Euros per MBD diagnoses is obtained from own calculations using data from the German Federal Statistical Office (for the age group 15-45 in 2015). \href{https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Health/Cost-Illness/Tables/disease-categories-age.html}{Destatis (2015)} provides the cost of illnesses by disease and age group.} The effects on MBD are particularly interesting as this disease category is the most prevalent chapter in this age group and it exhibits the longest average length of stay for in-patients, which makes this chapter rather expensive in comparison to other disease types.\footnote{The average length of stay for MBD diagnoses is 20.1 days  in comparison to a general average of 7.6 days \cite[p. 5]{statistisches2012diagnosedaten}.}\newline




% Relation to the literature
This article is related to previous literature in the following ways. First, it relates to a large literature about early childhood experiences on later life outcomes. \cite{currie2011human} and \cite{almond2017childhood} offer detailed summaries of recent work in that strand of research. Most of the literature that investigates the long-run impacts of maternity leave focuses on human capital accumulation and labor market outcomes of children. 
On the one hand, there are studies that find positive effects of leave duration on child outcomes. Among these, \cite{albagli2018} use a reform in Chile that increased paid maternity leave from 12 to 24 weeks in 2011. They find that the extension leads to a positive effect on children's cognitive skills, with larger effects for children from a disadvantaged background. Furthermore, they find increased breastfeeding (both at the extensive and intensive margin), and reduced levels of maternal stress. \cite{carneiro2015flying} studies the impact of a Norwegian reform in 1977, which increases the eligibility from 12 weeks of unpaid leave to 4 months paid and 12 months of unpaid leave. They find that the extension decreases the likelihood to drop-out from high school and increases earnings of individuals when aged 30. \cite{danzer2017} investigate an extension of parental leave duration in Austria. In 1990, paid and job protected paternity leave was extended from 12 to 24 months. The authors find no effect on PISA scores in the pooled sample, but positive effects for children from a high SES background (in particular boys). This is true when the reform induced a substitution of informal with maternal care. \cite{ginja2020parental} exploit a birth spacing eligibility cutoff in the Swedish leave system with the help of a regression discontinuity design and find that higher levels of parental leave benefits improve educational outcomes of the older child. Namely, there is an increase of children's cumulative GPA in ninth grade and a higher probability to have attended college by age 24. On the other hand, there are studies that find null effects. For instance, \cite{Dahl2016Case} investigate a series of policy reforms in Norway in the period from 1987 to 1992. In these legislation changes paid ML was increased from 18 to 35 weeks. The find little effects on children's school outcomes, such as performance in written exams in ninth grade and the probability to drop out from high school. 

Second, this article is related to the literature about the impact of (maternity) leave on short-run health outcomes. In contrast to the previous point, the results in  this strand of the literature are unambiguous. For example, \cite{bullinger2019effect} considers the health effects of California's paid family leave policy. She finds improvements in infants' (aged 0 or 1) overall health and reductions in asthma rates. Moreover, the results suggest that maternal mental health is improving due to the paid leave program. 




effect really depends on concrete setting of the reform

The main contribution of this paper is to provide causal estimates of the length of ML on \textit{long-run} child health outcomes. 
closest study: : \cite{danzer2019parental} disability status, fit for military service, finding positive effects on children's health status but none for educational attainment and labor market outcomes. No heterogeneity by gender or SES, but by counterfactual mode of care (pos effects in regions with no nursery).

\textbf{From the abstract of my submission to the dggö}



, I provide new insights into the trajectory of health differentials over the life-cycle.
I find a positive effect of the legislative change on several measures of long-term child health. My intention-to-treat estimates suggest that children who were born shortly after the implementation of the reform experience fewer hospital admissions.
In particular, I see that this decline in hospital admissions is due to fewer diagnoses of mental and behavioral disorders (the most common diagnoses for individuals aged 15-35) and that the effect is mostly driven by males andoccurs towards the end of the observed time period (at the end of 20s up to 35). Last, the largest effect is observed for mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive substance use and schizophrenia. 
 \newline



I contribute to the growing literature on parental leave and child development by adding new and unique insights into long-run health effects. Furthermore, it is crucial to understand the implications of maternity leave on various aspects of child development and outcomes for a comprehensive assessment of the cost and benefits of such leave schemes. These results illustrate the vast impact that early childhood conditions can have on later life (health) outcomes. My intention-to-treat estimates suggest that the expansion in maternity leave from two to six months has a positive impact on children’s health in the long-run.
% Due to the fact that (long-run) health outcomes were not so much in the center of the discussion and the health effects under investigation only materialize later in life, I hope to add to the current debate about the costs and benefits of such leave schemes.

% BACKGROUND
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\newpage
\section{Background}\label{sec:background}
\subsection[Reform]{Institutional Set-Up}
%reform
In contrast to the United States, maternity leave laws have been established much longer in Germany.\footnote{The following facts about maternity leave and benefit legislation are based on information in \cite{DIW2002}, \cite{schonberg2014expansions}, \cite{Dustmann2012}, and \cite{zmarzlik1999mutterschutzgesetz}. The leave scheme described here does not correspond to the current system, which is in place since 2007. \cite{Kluve2013} offer a good overview about the present leave regulations.} Before another reform took place in 1986, only mothers were eligible for job-protected leave. Since the mid 1950s, employed mothers held the right to a paid protection period of six weeks before and eight weeks after child birth, in which they were supposed not to work. During that 'mother protection period' women were protected from being dismissed and upon their return to work they had the right to be placed to a job, which is comparable with their prior assignment. The benefits in this period corresponded to a 100\% replacement rate and equaled women's average income over the three months before childbirth.\footnote{The payment was co-funded by public health insurance funds (750 DM per month), the federal government (400 DM, one-time payment) and employers (the remainder).} This pre-reform setting is to some extent comparable to the current maximum of 12 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave in the US (under the FMLA) and the minimum of 14 weeks of paid, job-protected leave in the EU \citep{guertzgen2018}.\footnote{Since the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), mothers in the US are entitled to leave if they have been working for at least one year with their employer, have accumulated a minimum of 1250 working hours during that year, and if they have been working for an employer with at least 50 employees \citep{baum2003effect}.} \newline

In 1979, the socio-liberal coalition of chancellor Helmut Schmidt passed a reform bill, which introduced four extra months after the end of the mother protection period. In other words, the total length of maternity leave after childbirth (job protection and benefits) was increased from eight weeks to six months (see Figure \ref{fig: MLreform}).\footnote{Compare with: "Gesetz zur Einführung eines Mutterschutzurlaubes" (Maternity leave law), Bundesgesetzblatt (Federal law gazette), Part I, Nr. 32, p.797-802, 30.06.1979 (see Figure \ref{fig: bundesgesetzblatt_antjehuber}).} The federal government wanted primarily to safeguard maternal health after childbirth with this reform. However, positive spill-over effects on the child were pleasantly acknowledged.\footnote{Gesetzesentwurf der Bundesregierung (Draft bill), Drucksache 8/2613.} While the initial benefits of the period from six weeks before and eight weeks after childbirth were not changed, the payments were equal to 750 DM from the third month after delivery. This amount corresponded to approximately 44\% of average prebirth earnings in 1979 \citep{schonberg2014expansions}. Although eligibility for maternity leave was universal among working women, take-up rates were not. The approximated maternity leave take-up rate was slightly below 40\% in 1979 \citep{Dustmann2012}.\footnote{It may be that the true share of mothers who was on leave is higher. This is due to the fact that \cite{Dustmann2012} approximate this share as the ratio of the number of women on leave in their data set ($\sim$ 80\% of the workforce) divided by the number of births in that year.}
%It should last until the 1986 reform until all mothers (irrespective of their employment status) and fathers became eligibile for parental leave.
\newline

The reform was initiated by a draft bill on January 05, 1979. The final law was ratified by the German Bundesrat (the Upper House of the German Parliament) on May 19 and by the German Bundestag (the Lower House) on June 22, 1979. All previously employed women, who gave birth on or after May 01, 1979, were eligible for six months of maternity leave after childbirth, whereas mothers, who delivered their baby before the cutoff date were entitled to the 'common' two months of job-protected maternity leave. Note that the short time span between draft bill and when the reform took effect made strategic conceptions impossible. This implies that families in my sample could not adjust their behavior in response to the reform and the 1979 extension in maternity leave can be seen as a quasi-experiment. This issue is discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:empirical_strategy_threats+validity}.\newline

% FEMALE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AND CHILDCARE SITUATION
\subsection{Female Labor Force Participation and Childcare Situation}
In April 1979, almost every second woman aged 15 to 65 years (49.7\%) was active on the labor market and female labor market attachment made up around 38\% of the labor force \citep{federalstatisticaloffice1981yearbook}.\footnote{As a comparison, 50.6\% of all women in the US participated in the labor market at the same time (see US Bureau of Labor Statistics).} Yet, there is pronounced heterogeneity in female labor force participation rates. For instance, female labor market attachment was at 62.4\% for singles, 45.2\% for married, 32.5\% for widowed, and 76.5\% for divorced women. Additionally, there was a strong gradient with respect to age. While 69.2\% of all women aged between 20 and 25 years were participating in the labor force, the share is 55.0\% for women in the age bracket between 30 and 35 years.\footnote{84\% of all children were delivered by
women aged 20 to 35, which makes these women the relevant age group in this context \citep{federalstatisticaloffice1981yearbook}.} The high numbers for younger women and singles indicate that a high share of mothers-to-be were an active part of the labor force and thus eligible for maternity leave. \newline 
%between year1 and year 2, maternal labor market attachment increased from..x to y 

Nevertheless, next to the female labor force participation rate, it is the counterfactual mode of care that has an impact on how the reform can alter children's outcomes. \cite{danzer2019parental} show that the 1990 parental leave expansion in Austria had a positive effect on children in regions where there was no formal childcare.\footnote{The Austrian reform increased paid and job-protected parental leave from one year to two years.} In other words, there were only positive effects of the reform in cases when informal child care was substituted with parental care. The provision of childcare in West Germany in the late 1970s was characterized by a situation that would allow a shift from informal to maternal care. \cite{hank2001childcare} describe the situation at that time as a \textit{'patchwork [of] childcare arrangements'}, meaning that parents had to rely on a broad range of care types, such as parental care, day care centers, social networks, and private child minders. The different forms varied greatly in cost and quality. In 1980, only 1.5\% of children attended a public \textit{Krippe} (nursery, for children aged 0 to 3) \citep[p.~34]{bildungsbericht2006}.\footnote{In the 1970s, the provision of part-time care for pre-schoolers (4-6 years) was established. However, parents did not have the legal entitlement to a slot in a public \textit{Kindergarten} until 1996. For toddlers (1-3 years), parents had a legal claim to a care slot in a \textit{Krippe} since 2013.} Thus, due to the fact that public daycare was basically nonexistent, parents had to rely almost exclusively on informal care, apart from parental care. This makes the situation in the Federal Republic of Germany in the late 1970s quite comparable to the situation of \cite{danzer2019parental} in which informal arrangements were substituted with maternal care.

\subsection[Effects of 1979 Reform on Outcomes]{Effects of the 1979 Maternity Leave Reform on Maternal and Child Labor Market Outcomes}
%[XXX Ich habe jetzt pro Aspekt die beiden Zusammengeworfen und nicht jedes paper für sich behandelt, notwendig da SL zB mehr in die Tiefe geht bei maternal outcomes]
The effects of the 1979 maternity leave reform has been investigated by \cite{Dustmann2012}, \cite{schonberg2014expansions}, and \cite{guertzgen2018}.\footnote{Both, \cite{Dustmann2012} and \cite{schonberg2014expansions} analyze the impact of the expansion in maternity leave on maternal labor market outcomes. While the former study evaluates additionally changes in child outcomes due to the reform, the latter study focuses on maternal labor market outcomes but elicits more in-depth results.} The first two studies show that the reform has a large impact on mothers' labor market outcomes, particularly in the short-run. \newline First, many mothers adjust their labor supply downwards during the four months of extra leave, and return to the labor market as soon as the leave period terminates. In contrast, there is only a limited effect on long-run maternal labor supply (i.e. for the time period beyond six months after childbirth). For instance, the reform decreases the share of mothers who returned to the labor market by the third (52nd) month after childbirth by 30.5 (around one) percentage points.\footnote{When looking at long-run maternal labor force participation rates (at the child's sixth birthday), one can see that the reform leads to a modest increase in the probability a mother is working. The implication is that the mothers who abstain from the labor market in the long-run, would have only returned to work temporarily in absence of the reform.}
In total, the change of postnatal maternity leave from two to six months causes mothers to postpone their return to work by, on average, 0.835 months.\footnote{This number corresponds to the number of months away from work in the first 40 months since childbirth.} Approximately two-third of the decline in short-run female labor force participation is the result from a contraction in full-time work. \newline
Second, the expansion in maternity leave leads to changes in mothers' income. When focusing on mere labor market income there is no effect of the reform that is significantly different from zero. However, when maternity benefit payments are included in the income measure, there is an overall increase in cumulative total income by, on average, 1,700 Deutschmarks (DM).\footnote{Maternal cumulative total income is defined as the accumulated total income up to the point when the child is 40 months old. It consists of monthly earnings when the mother is working, equals to the benefits when she is on leave, and is zero otherwise.} This increase in cumulative total income is the result of a dominating effect of unexpected extra income for mothers who would have stayed at home even without the reform over the decrease in available income stemming from the reduction in maternal employment. There is a strong effect heterogeneity in cumulative income across wages: mothers in the lowest tercile of the wage distribution have 2,850 DM of additional income, while the increase for women in the highest tercile amounts to 1,050 DM. \newline
% vielleicht nochmal wrap up wie in der Discussion von SL, short-run effet on maternal employment yes - LR nichts verbessert, no depreciation of HC... 
Although there are distinct effects on maternal labor market outcomes, in particular in the short-run, \cite{Dustmann2012} do not find evidence that the reform has an impact on children's educational attainment and labor market outcomes. They do not find any effect of the reform on years of education, wages, or the share of individuals in full-time employment. \newline

% so strong effect on mother's return to work behavior given but so far in the domains that were looked at, there are no effects on children's long-run outcomes.

\cite{guertzgen2018} investigate the impact of the 1979 reform on mothers long-term ($>$ 6 weeks) sickness absence after childbirth. They find that mothers who give birth after the threshold exhibit more long-term sickness spells compared to mothers who give birth before the cutoff date. For instance, post-reform mothers have a 3.1 percentage points higher probability of having ever experienced a long-term illness spell by the third year after childbirth. This result remains the same even after controlling for observable health differences. Furthermore, they suggest a selection story in which mothers with worse health status are more likely to return to the labor market and that this group is by a large extent driving the adverse health effects in response to the reform.\newline

\subsection[Channels]{Potential Channels and Prior Belief on Health Effects}
The notion that later-life outcomes have their origins in early-childhood is not new. In 1990, \citeauthor{Barker1990origins} postulated the idea that conditions in-utero and during infancy have long-lasting effects on later life health. Adult physical and mental wellbeing is influenced by early experiences - whether they are good or bad - in at least two ways \citep{shonkoff2009neuroscience}.\newline On the one hand, early experiences can operate via a \emph{cumulative} process, in which physically and psychologically stressful events are experienced again and again. The persistent experience of stressful events causes a constant provocation of neurobiological responses, which in turn may precipitate chronic health impairments eventually. Under normal circumstances, these responses are healthy and protective, because they help you cope with stress.\footnote{The neurobiological reactions can include, for instance, the release of stress hormones, higher blood pressure and heart rate, protective mobilization of nutrients, among other. See for example \cite{mcewen1998stress} or \cite{shonkoff2009neuroscience}.} Yet, due to the repetitive activation, the neurobiological reactions may become pathogenic.\newline On the other hand, the environment at key developmental stages is \emph{biologically embedded} into regulatory physiological systems such that it can impact adult disease and risk factors latently. In these sensitive periods, the developing brain's architecture is modified considerably and is particularly sensitive to environmental stimuli. The process, in which experiences are "programmed" into the brain's architecture, starts in the embryonic state and culminates in the first years of life \citep{raikkonen2012early}. As not all brain circuits develop at the same time, the timing of the experience is crucial.\footnote{See the 'life-cycle' model of stress \citep{lupien2009effects}.} A stimulus has the highest impact on the brain region, which undergoes the most change at the time when the experience is made.\footnote{Yet, the effects on later life health impairment are not only determined by the timing, but also by the type of the experience \citep{raikkonen2012early}.} During infancy (the period of life that is affected by the reform), the hippocampus is the area of the brain that is maturing most rapidly and is consequently more vulnerable than during other stages. This region is tied to the regulation of emotions, social behavior, stress responsiveness, and ultimately mental health \citep{center2016best,shonkoff2009neuroscience}. \newline In both cases - the cumulative exposure and the programming - the effects of experiences made in early life may be latent at first until the onset of a particular condition \citep{almond2011fetalorigins}. The time lag can be many years, even decades \citep{shonkoff2009neuroscience}.\newline


% how the 1979 maternity leave reform might affect early life conditions of the newborns
Before proceeding with the analysis, I provide a short discussion how the child's environment may be altered by the 1979 maternity leave reform, i.e. potential mechanisms through which the reform could affect child health outcomes. For this purpose, I consider differences in care quality, parental health differentials, and changes in family income as potential pathways how the reform may affect long-run child health outcomes. \newline %disoriented attachment patterns

% more maternal time - higher quality of care
First, the reform induced mothers to postpone their return to the labor market and allowed more maternal time during a crucial time period for child development. With more time at home, mothers are more likely to breastfeed and do so for an extended period \citep{baker2008maternal,berger2005earlymaternal}.\footnote{The German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) presents representative data on breastfeeding rates from 1986 onwards \citep{lange2007breastfeeding}. From the West-German 1986 cohort born, around 75\% of children were breastfed at least once and the share of children who was breastfed exclusively for half a year is roughly 38\%.} Breastfeeding is known to have a wide array of medical benefits.\footnote{The World Health Organization recommends that \textit{"infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health"} (\href{http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/}{\nolinkurl{http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/breastfeeding/en/}}).} The advantages for children that were breastfed range from reduced incidence or severity of asthma, allergies, diarrhea, mortality, morbidity and chronic conditions in the short run, to lower prevalence rates of overweight as well as obesity, and type II diabetes in adulthood \citep{ruhm2000parental, victora2016breastfeeding}. Moreover, there is correlational evidence that the length of breastfeeding is negatively associated with mental health problems and adverse health behavior (drinking) \citep{oddy2010longterm,falk2016early}. Next to these direct health effects, there are also indirect effects of breastfeeding via third outcomes, which in turn may affect health. For example, breastfeeding exhibits a positive effect on cognitive development \citep{albagli2018}, educational attainment and income \citep{victoria2015association}, the formation of preferences \citep{falk2016early}, and the quality of mother-child interactions \citep{papp2014longitudinal}. \newline 
In addition to reduced breastfeeding, early maternal employment impedes the monitoring of children's health status. \cite{berger2005earlymaternal} present associations of maternal employment and a decrease in the use of preventive health care services (immunizations and 'well-baby' visits), while at the same time problems with externalizing behavior exacerbate. \cite{morrill2011} presents instrumental variable estimates, which suggest that maternal employment leads to a higher likelihood that the child suffers from an adverse health event (overnight hospitalization, asthma episode, or injury/poisoning).\newline

% Parental/ maternal health outcomes
Second, another mechanism of how the reform might impact child health outcomes are
changes in maternal health outcomes, which successively may affect the ability to nurture.\footnote{See for instance \cite{patel2004} or \cite{frech2011maternal}.} There is correlational evidence indicating that more maternal employment is related to lower levels of maternal mental well-being as well as self-rated overall health, and a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and problems with parenting stress \citep{chatterji2005does,Chatterji2013}. Besides the correlational evidence, there exists a large body of quasi-experimental literature. \cite{beuchert2016} exploit a reform of the parental leave scheme in Denmark and find positive effects on health outcomes of mothers and siblings with larger gains for low-resource families.\footnote{The Danish reform increased post-birth maternity leave by, on average, 32 days. The length of paid leave was increased from 24 weeks (14 weeks maternity and 10 weeks of joint leave) to 46 weeks (14 ML + 32 joint).} \cite{butikofer2018impact} exploit the 1977 maternity leave reform in Norway in order to demonstrate how the legislation change enhances a battery of mid- and long-term maternal health outcomes, such as BMI, blood pressure, pain as well as mental health, and more favorable health behavior (physical exercise and smoking abstinence).\footnote{The pre-reform scheme of 12 weeks of unpaid leave was changed to 4 months of paid and 12 months of unpaid leave.} \cite{albagli2018} show in the Chilean context that mothers who give birth under a more generous leave regime have lower stress indices as compared to mothers who are shorter on leave.\footnote{The length of paid leave was raised from 12 to 24 weeks.} Summing up, there are beneficial effects of extending maternity leave on maternal health outcomes, which may enhance parents' ability to nurture.\newline 
% \cite{avendano2015long}



% Income & other outcomes (fertility)
Third, a shift in household income is another potential pathway for how the reform might affect child health outcomes. A considerable amount of research has been concerned with the positive association of family income with child cognitive achievement and health outcomes. Some studies have exploited expansions in the earned income tax credit (EITC) in order to investigate effects of household income on child outcomes. \cite{dahl2012impact} find that an increase in family income goes hand in hand with a boost in math and reading test scores, with the highest gains made among children with a low socioeconomic status (SES). \cite{hoynes2015income} identify that an increase in household income concurs with a reduced likelihood of low birth weight, which is induced by more prenatal care and less adverse health behavior such as smoking. Recently, the literature has been focusing on the associations between SES and functional brain development \citep{tomalski2013}. In order to evaluate the causal effect of economic resources in early childhood on cognitive, socio-emotional and brain development, an RCT has been established and is still running until 2022.\footnote{The experiment with the title "Household Income and Child Development in the First Three Years of Life" is led by Greg Duncan.} \newline
Another aspect related to family income is that women's share of household income may decrease when they go on leave. This is problematic, for the reason that expenditures for child goods are often correlated with women's relative income share. The basis for this intra-household conflict may be rooted in asymmetric preferences for household goods across men and women \citep{anderson2002economics}.\footnote{The problem with intra-household allocation of resources and child well-being is not only found in developing countries, but was also a rationale for changing child benefit structures in the UK in the late 1970s \citep{lundberg1996bargaining}. Prior to the reform the benefit was basically a tax reduction for fathers, which was replaced by a cash payment to mothers in the hope that "kids do better".}\newline
%The effect of parental income must not be underestimated as \cite{case2002economic} mention that the impact of parental income on children's health status is partly responsible for the intergenerational transmission mechanisms of socioeconomic status, due to the fact that adverse health effects of lower income are accumulated over children's life.

As the reform improved children's environment in the context of the previously raised points, I expect a-priori positive health differentials for children born under the more generous leave scheme.

% DATA & VARIABLES
%--------------------------------------------------------------------
\bigskip
\section{Data}\label{sec:data} 
% Description data
I use hospital register data spanning the period from 1995 to 2014, provided by the Research Data Centers of the Federal Statistical Office and the statistical offices of the Länder.\footnote{Due to data confidentiality regulations data access was provided on-site at the research data center.} The register contains information on the universe of German in-patient cases (in 2014: 19.6 million observations). It covers \textit{all} patients that were discharged from \textit{any} hospital or medical prevention/rehabilitation facility in Germany in the reporting year.\footnote{The data does not cover hospitals of the penal system and police hospitals. Military hospitals are included to the extent in which they offer services to civilians. Medical prevention/rehabilitation centers are included since 2003 if they have more than 100 beds. This criterion might potentially exclude establishments with a specialized range of treatments. Among the ten most frequent diagnoses made in prevention/rehabilitation facilities, one can find diseases of the musculoskeletal system, of the circulatory system, and mental illnesses.} The data includes the patient's main diagnosis, socio-demographic characteristics (month and year of birth, gender, and postal code of the place of residence), the length of stay, whether the patient died or underwent surgery, and in which medicating specialist department the patient stayed the longest.\newline 
%https://www.destatis.de/EN/FactsFigures/SocietyState/Health/PreventionRehabilitationFacilities/PreventionRehabilitationFacilities.html

%ICD Classification
The main diagnosis indicates the major reason for the patient's hospital admission. It is coded according to the guidelines of the "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" (ICD), which are maintained by the World Health Organization (WHO).\footnote{Please note that the data exploits a German modification that is issued by the German Institute of Medical Documentation (DIMDI) - a subordinate authority of the Federal Ministry of Health.} Up to and including 1999, the coding follows the ICD-9 classification, since 2000 the ICD-10 system is in place.\footnote{The numbers of the ICD classification refer to the revision, which is in place at the year of reporting. The ICD-9 classification is a 3 digit numeric code, whereas the ICD-10 is a 3 digit alphanumeric code.} Table \ref{tab:outcomes_coding_main_chapters} provides a summary of the frequencies of diagnosis categories. These categories are called chapters and together constitute my hospitalization variable.\footnote{I exclude diagnoses related to pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium, among others that occur very infrequently.} Next to the summary statistics, the table reports how the disease categories are mapped into the classification systems. In my pooled sample, consequences of external causes are the most frequent diagnosis type, followed closely by mental and behavioral disorders, and diseases of the digestive system. A similar pattern can be found in the cross-section: Figure \ref{fig: top5diagnosis_in_2014_across_agegroups} gives an overview of the five most common diseases and health problems that were diagnosed for individuals aged between 0 and 35 years in 2014. For the age group that I observe in my sample, i.e. people between 15 and 35 years, mental and behavioral disorders are the most common diagnoses (357 thousand diagnoses), followed by injuries (310 thousand diagnoses), and diseases of the digestive system (260 thousand diagnoses). \newline %Thus, the same three health problems constitute the top 3 diagnoses. 


% Descriptives hospital admission
Figure \ref{fig: descriptive_hospital_admission} illustrates trends in hospital admissions for the treatment and control cohort from 1996 to 2014. In panel A, one can observe a S-shaped line for the number of admissions. The rate of hospitalization is increasing until age 19 (35,000 cases per year), then decreasing up to the age of 26 after which the number of admissions are growing again (in 2014, there are 40,500 admissions). In panel B, one can see that the share of women is decreasing from 55\% in 1995 to below 48\% in 2014. Panel C shows a reduction in the average length of stay from 7.7 days to 6 days from the beginning to the end of the observation period. Panel D shows a hump-shaped evolution of surgeries that are related with hospitalization. The share of surgeries for in-patient cases is increasing up to the age of 22, then declining until the age of 26. After that, the share of in-patients with a surgery stays constant at around 35\%.\newline %Panel E displays the fraction of people that died during hospitalization, which is around 2 deaths per 1,000 hospitalizations over the entire time frame. 



% Outcomes and aggregation
I aggregate the number of diagnoses per chapter by birth month, birth year, and survey year. In the next step, I define the outcomes as the number of diagnoses per 1,000 individuals.\footnote{In my baseline specification, I use the monthly number of births in the denominator (based on Federal vital statistics). In the robustness section, I present results with the approximated number of current inhabitants on different regional levels. The advantage of using the original number of births is twofold. First, I can trace out differentials for a longer period, because the population data is only available from 2003 onwards. Second, I avoid to induce measurement error in my dependent variable due to the fact that there is only information on the number of individuals aged $x$ years. In order to obtain an approximated number of persons per birth-month, I assign them using weights from either the German Micro Census or the original fertility distribution.} For my baseline specification, I use all hospitalizations of individuals who reside in the area of the former Federal Republic of Germany.\footnote{Due to the fact that Berlin cannot be assigned to either FRG or GDR unambiguously, it is dropped from the analysis.} Thus, for my DiD baseline specification, I have a pseudo-panel with $2\times12\times20=480$ (cohorts$\times$month-of-birth$\times$years) observations. Yet, in order to avoid any confounding that might be triggered by differential maturity effects between treatment and control group, I want to compare the two birth cohorts at the same age. To achieve this, I shift a control observation from period $t$ to period $t+1$, which decreases the number of effective observations to $456$.\footnote{The shifting reduces the number of observations at the beginning and the end of the observed time frame. For instance, in 1995, the treatment (control) group is aged 16 (17). As there is no control group that is aged 16, I omit these 12 months of the treatment group from the sample. The control group that is already 17 years old is shifted to 1996. Analogously, I drop the control group in 2014.} \newline % popf - seit 2003 macht die 58,752 observationen; popmz sogar erst seit 2005 48,960

% I refrain from using the absolute numbers as the month-of-birth cohorts vary substantially in size (due to e.g. number of days per month or seasonality of births over one year).


% Vorteile data
The data set has three main advantages. First, compared to survey data, the hospital registry data covers the universe of German in-patient cases and is consequently not prone to sampling errors or problems associated with attrition. Additionally, the large number of patients are useful in order to identifying local effects. Second, due to the longitudinal character of the data set, I am able to trace out the trajectory of children's health differentials over 20 years of their adulthood. Third, there is almost surely no measurement error. On the one hand, this might affect the birth date, which is accurate to the month in my context. This is particularly relevant as the time of birth is the deciding factor whether an individual's mother is eligible for the more generous leave scheme or not. \cite{Dustmann2012} do not have information about the exact birth date and have to impute the month-of-birth. On the other hand, the lack of measurement error holds for the outcome variables, as well. As the diagnosis code matters for remuneration, the ICD code is of a very high quality. Moreover, in comparison with self-reported survey data, administrative data does not suffer from issues related to social desirability bias.\newline

%Nachteile
Nevertheless, the data set has some drawbacks, too. First, the source of data limits me to analyze rather severe health events, which are encountered in the context of hospitals and medical prevention/rehabilitation centers. Yet, some health conditions, which are diagnosed elsewhere (e.g. at a practitioner), might be even more affected than the diagnoses that I observe.  % A priori I expect to find an effect for the types of health outcomes, which are particularly salient in the hospital registry data.
%In a way, I just scratch the tip of the iceberg 
%{\color{red} Max: Hausarztbesuche}
Second, although the registry data is rich in both, the numbers of cases and the quality of its entries, it contains only few socio-economic variables. This implies that next to the average effects of the 1979 maternity leave reform, I can demonstrate results for selected subgroups only. Last, connected to the previous point, I do not have information about the place of birth, implying that the region in which I observe a patient does not necessarily have to coincide with the patient's place of birth. Ideally, I would like to exclude individuals from the analysis whose mothers were not affected by the reform, such as foreign-born children and children born in the German Democratic Republic (GDR). Yet, as I am unable to do so, the results get diluted such that my ITT estimates are reduced in size. The implicit assumption is that migration to the area of the former FRG occurred at random (with respect to the month-of-birth). In order to refute this concern to some extent, my baseline specification is aggregated to the level of the former FRG and GDR and I rely on more disaggregated data only for the investigation of effect heterogeneity and robustness tests. In this way, I hope to limit the impact of within region migration of the area of the former FRG or GDR. \newline

\section{Empirical Strategy}\label{sec:empirical_strategy}
\subsection{Design}\label{sec:empirical_strategy_1design}
In order to estimate the causal effect of the length of maternity leave, I exploit the 1979 reform's eligibility rule, which is contingent on children's birth date (see section \ref{sec:background}). Children born on/after the specified birth cutoff date (May 01, 1979) fall under the new regime, in which their mothers are eligible for six months of maternity leave after childbirth. Mothers of children born before the threshold are entitled to two months of postnatal leave. Assignment to one of the two schemes is a deterministic function of the birth date of the child. A regression discontinuity design (RDD) might constitute a first potential identification strategy, in which one compares children's health outcomes that are quite similar with the only notable exception that their mothers are entitled to different lengths of maternity leave. I augment this idea of a local identification by combining the RDD with a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach. A large body of literature suggests that there is a strong relationship between season of birth (SOB), health and other socioeconomic outcomes. The seasonality may come about due to reasons that are associated with either pre- or postnatal factors. First, the seasonality might arise due to selective conception, i.e. the socioeconomic composition of mothers varies over time \citep{buckles2013season}. Second, \cite{currie2013within} argue that SOB effects may be coming from seasonal patterns of in-utero disease prevalence (e.g. influenza) and nutrition. Last, the seasonality aspect may also be the result of social postnatal factors such as age-based cutoff rules at school-entry \citep{black2011too}. \newline The estimated health differentials of children born before and after the reform date might be biased when these SOB effects are not accounted for: The estimated effect might partly be driven by the difference of health outcomes stemming from the seasonality component and not so much by the expansion in maternity leave coverage itself. Yet, by matching up the difference in health outcomes of children born within a distance to the birth cutoff date in which the legislation change took place (henceforth referred to as the treatment cohort) with differences in outcomes of children born around the same threshold one year prior the reform (control group), I can eliminate the seasonality component while preserving the local identification aspect. The implicit identifying assumption is that seasonality is time-invariant, i.e. treatment and control group share the same SOB effects.\newline

My main specification to estimating the effect of the length of maternity leave on children's health outcomes corresponds to the following equation: \footnote{The estimation procedure can also be found in similar contexts in \cite{RafaelLaliveandJosefZweimuller2009}, \cite{Dustmann2012}, \cite{Ekberg2013parental}, \cite{schonberg2014expansions}, \cite{Lalive2014}, \cite{Huebener2017}, \cite{danzer2017}, \cite{guertzgen2018}, and \cite{avdic2018modern}.}
\begin{align}
\text{Y}_{mt} = \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{Treat}_{m} + \gamma_2 \text{After}_{m} + \gamma_3 (\text{Treat}_{m} \times \text{After}_{m}) + \psi_m + \rho_t + \varepsilon_{mt} \label{eq:DD_basline}
\end{align}
where $\text{Y}_{mt}$ is the number of diagnoses per thousand individuals of the cohort born in month $m$, at time period $t$. The treatment cohort is represented by $\text{Treat}_{m}$, a dichotomous variable equal to one for groups that are born shortly before and after the legislation change. In the analysis, I present results for different estimation windows around the threshold date. In the widest specification this involves children, who are born between November 1978 and October 1979, implying a bandwidth of half a year around the cutoff. As control group, I choose the cohort born in the same months, but in the year prior to the reform.\footnote{\cite{Dustmann2012} use in total three birth cohorts as control group, two cohorts before and one cohort after the treatment cohort: group 1 born 11/1976-10/1976, group 2 born 11/1977-10/1978, and group 3 born 11/1979-10/1980. My control cohort is identical to the one used by \cite{guertzgen2018}. \newline I choose the cohort prior to the treatment cohort as control group in my main specification for two reasons. First, with more cohorts as control groups, it may be less likely that the identifying assumption (time-invariance of seasonality) is met. Second, taking a birth cohort in the year after the policy change as control group might invalidate the comparability between the treatment and control group as parents might have enough time to react to the reform and adjust fertility patterns. Nevertheless, I present results when adding more control cohorts in the robustness section.} $\text{After}_{m}$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one if the individuals are born in/after the threshold month May (i.e. born in May-October in the widest specification, for both treatment and control cohort). $\psi_m$, $\rho_t$ are month-of-birth and survey year fixed effects, respectively. Initially, $\text{Y}_{mt}$ corresponds to outcomes observed over the pooled period 1995-2014. I successively break up the entire time frame in different age groups until I apply a life-course approach by running the regression for each year of life separately.\newline 
The parameter of interest is $\gamma_3$, which captures the effect of the policy change on health outcomes. As I do not have information whether the individuals' mothers were on leave, the identified parameter is an intention-to-treat effect. \newline
 %The interaction term $Treat_{mr} * After_{mr}$ equals one for the group of interest (the children born between May and October 1979,i.e. the post-reform children in the treatment group).

\subsection{Potential Threats \& Validity of the Identification}\label{sec:empirical_strategy_threats+validity}
Behavioral responses with respect to the forcing variable (the birth date of the child) would jeopardize the validity of the identification strategy. Usually, the occurrence of birth can be considered as a random event, given the date of conception.\footnote{Gestation length is a normally distributed random variable with mean of 40 weeks and 2 weeks standard deviation \citep{Ekberg2013parental}.} However, parents may influence the time when their baby is born in two ways. \newline
First, parents may be induced to get strategically pregnant in response to the more attractive leave scheme. Yet, it is unlikely that there are children in my sample who were conceived in this way. The draft bill (January 1979) was only proposed four months before the threshold birth date (May 1979) and the widest specification includes children who were born at the latest in October 1979, the month in which the earliest possible birth date would be. However, it could be imaginable that the topic aroused public awareness due to media coverage even before the draft bill was initiated. For that reason, \cite{Dustmann2012} conduct a literature search for any articles about the reform. They find the earliest articles published two months prior to the cutoff date.\newline
Second, Mothers with due dates close to the cutoff date on May 1, 1979 could time the birth date of their child by postponing induced births and cesarean sections.\footnote{Shifting a planned birth to before the threshold seems rather unlikely, because this behavior would destroy mothers' eligibility to a more generous leave scheme.} \cite{gans2009born} find that during the introduction of a \$3.000 "Baby Bonus" in Australia, parents postpone the birth by as much as a week in order to be eligible for the benefits: the data shows a sharp decline in the birth rate before the threshold, followed by a huge increase on the first day after the cutoff.\newline
It is possible that there are similar distortionary "introduction effects" in the context of the 1979 maternity leave expansion. In other words, even though the announcement period does not allow for a strategic conception, parents may be incentivized to delay the delivery of their child due to the reform.\footnote{Yet, the scope of this effect is much smaller, because the C-section/induced birth rate in the FRG around 1980 was significantly lower than its counterpart in Australia in 2004.} \newline %{\color{red} Quelle?}


% validity
In order to check the existence of potential behavioral responses, I investigate the fertility distribution around the cutoff. I follow the example of \cite{gans2009born} closely to show that there are no peculiarities in the fertility distribution. In my analysis I use daily births from the federal states of Baden-Württemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia over the window 1977-1990.\footnote{Appendix Figure \ref{fig: fertility_hist} shows monthly births per day for both treatment and control cohort. Although the figure utilizes all childbirths from the former region of the Federal Republic of Germany, it is difficult to see whether parents shifted births from April to May. For that reason, I use daily births from two federal states.} Both states together act as a good proxy for the entire area of the former FRG as they account for almost 36\% of all births in 1979. In my analysis, I limit the sample to a time window of one month before and after the cutoff date. Panel A of Figure \ref{fig: fertilitydistr} shows the (unadjusted) daily number of births for April and May 1979. Over the time window, one can observe a strong weekly pattern with more births on weekdays and less births on weekends. On May 01, which was a Tuesday, one can see a drop in the number of births, which seems unexpected. If parents want to move the time of birth, one would expect that there is a rise in the number of births right after the cutoff date. However, May 01 is a national public holiday (Labor Day) and birth rates are generally lower on public holidays. \newline 
%Panel B
Panel B of Figure \ref{fig: fertilitydistr} shows the time series when taking out any variation in the timing of births stemming from year, day of week, day of year, and public holidays. To do so, I estimate the following equation on all years, \emph{except} April and May 1979:
\begin{align}
\text{Births}_i = I^{\text{Year}}_i\times I^{\text{Day of Week}}_i + I^{\text{Day of Year}}_i + I^{\text{Public Holiday}}_i + \varepsilon_i \label{eq: validity_fig}
\end{align}
I regress the number of children born on day $i$, $\text{Births}_i$, on a series of dummies: year interacted with day of the week (allowing a different effect for Tuesdays in 1979), day of the year (permits a different effect for May 02), and a dummy for public national holidays.\footnote{For public holidays I use Good Friday, Holy Saturday, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, Labor Day, Ascension Day, Whit Sunday, Whit Monday, and Corpus Christi.} Parameters are left out for better readability. Panel B plots the residuals $(\text{Births}-\widehat{\text{Births}})$ from the calibrated model. In contrast to \cite{gans2009born}, I do not detect systematically fewer births than expected prior to the reform, nor more births than expected right after the policy change came into effect. Thus, graphically there is no evidence that parents moved the births to after the cutoff. \newline 
Table \ref{tab: validity_birth_rate} presents estimates of the effect of the maternity leave expansion on fertility outcomes, for different estimation windows.\footnote{I estimate: $f(\text{Births}_i) = I^{\text{Reform}}_i + I^{\text{Year}}_i\times I^{\text{Day of Week}}_i + I^{\text{Day of Year}}_i + I^{\text{Public Holiday}}_i + \varepsilon_i$, with the dummy $I^{\text{Reform}}_i$, which equals one for days after the cutoff in 1979.} Irrespective of whether I use the number of births or the log of the number of births, there is no evidence that suggests that parents postponed births to after the threshold. On the contrary, the point estimates are throughout negative and become significantly different from zero with increasing estimation windows. This indicates rather a reduction in fertility after the policy came into effect, if any.\footnote{Furthermore, the magnitude of the estimates are constant across estimation windows, which would seem counterintuitive if parents shifted the births from the week prior to the reform to the week after the reform. If such behavior were present, one would expect point estimates to decrease in absolute value as the estimation window is enlarged.} \newline 

%wrap up
By investigating the fertility distribution around the threshold, I do not find evidence that parents strategically delayed births in the reform year. For this reason, the 1979 maternity leave reform can be considered as a valid natural experiment. Nonetheless, to scrutinize the possibility that the identification strategy is not jeopardized by selective fertility changes, I analyze the robustness of the results by applying a Donut specification, in which I exclude children from the analysis who were born in the month before and after the policy was implemented.

%\subsection[The effect on hospital admission]{The effect of the 1979 maternity leave reform on hospitalizations}
\subsection{Hospital Admissions}


% Hospital - Total
Table \ref{tab: DD_hopsital2_total} reports difference-in-difference estimates of the impact of the maternity leave expansion on hospital admissions, using the specification in equation \ref{eq:DD_basline}. The dependent variable is the hospitalization rate, which is defined as the annual number of hospital admissions per 1,000 individuals.\footnote{The dependent variables are defined on the level of the MOB cohort and aggregated to the area of the former FRG.} Panel A presents ITT results based on the pooled data covering the years from 1995 to 2014 (age 17 to 35). The baseline coefficient in column 1 suggests that the maternity leave reform significantly reduces the fraction of annual inpatient treatments in hospitals by on average 2.1 cases per 1,000 individuals. This corresponds to a reduction by 1.7\% from the pre-treatment mean. The point estimate is very robust to using narrower estimation windows (columns 2 - 4) and to excluding children born close to the cut-off (children born in April and May - labeled as Donut specification).\footnote{The results obtained when using narrower bandwidths are less precisely estimated due to the smaller sample sizes. However, the point estimates do not differ significantly across the specifications.} Panel B contains DiD estimates when dividing the pooled sample into four age brackets. Although all estimates carry a negative sign, the coefficients of younger cohorts (17-21 as well as 22-26 years of age) are small and generally not significantly different from zero. The average effect on hospitalizations at older ages (27-31 and 32-35 years of age) is larger and significant. Consequently, the results indicate that the reform's impact on hospitalization rates is increasing with  children's age.

%alt: With my baseline specification that uses a bandwidth of half a year (column 4), I find that there are on average 2.076 fewer hospitalizations per 1,000 individuals for children whose mothers were eligible for prolonged maternity leave. In the next step, I vary the width of the estimation window from three months to half a year and run a "Donut" specification in which I omit children who are born in the months directly around the threshold (i.e. exclude children born in April and May). The point estimate is fairly robust to different estimation windows. 




% To investigate whether these effects are stable over the life-cycle or vary by age, I refine my analysis and consider how the effects of the maternity leave reform evolve with age. \natalia{If parents are aware of certain health problems of their offspring, it is well possible that they engage in additional health treatments to compensate for this disadvantage and any negative health differential might dissipate over time.} 

%ADD LATER: In principle one could expect that the effect diminishes with age - in particular in a country like Germany with a strong health system. CITE ALMOND/CURRIE Development under age 5!

%On average, I find not significant effects of the extended maternity leave on hospitalizations at younger ages (17-26 year-olds). However, with increasing age as the children grow older, the differentials are opening up for the cohorts aged 27-31 and 32-35. The magnitude of the effects are larger and statistically significant. 
%level of analysis is on MOBxYOBXyear level
 
% Hospital - Distinction Women and Men (tabelle)
In the next step, I explore whether these general findings hold similarly for men and women. Tables \ref{tab: DD_hopsital2_female} and \ref{tab: DD_hopsital2_male} show the effect of the 1979 maternity leave reform on hospital admissions for women and men, respectively. In general, the point estimates for men are mostly larger than the corresponding ones for women.\footnote{Yet, the baseline means are not significantly different from each other.} Furthermore, the effects for women are less robust to the choice of bandwidth than the effects for men, which mirror the overall effects from Table \ref{tab: DD_hopsital2_total} very closely. The DiD estimates suggest that men, whose mothers were eligible for an extended leave duration, have lower hospitalization rates, irrespective of the estimation window. In the pooled sample, I find an average reduction of 2.4 fewer hospital admissions per 1,000 individuals. Moreover, the effects for males increase in size the more the men grow older. 

% Hospital - life-course graph
A finer granularity with respect to age helps to identify the periods when the effects of the reform are particularly salient. Figure \ref{fig: lc_hospital2_frg_DD} shows the trajectories of the hospitalization differentials between treatment and control group on a yearly basis (ranging from age 17 up to 35).\footnote{I still control for any maturity effects and compare outcomes of treatment and control cohorts measured at the same age. Survey year fixed effects $\rho_t$ have to be omitted from the specification due to collinearity.} I estimate the specification as in equation \ref{eq:DD_basline} year by year and plot the DiD estimates (along with 90\%/95\% confidence intervals) across time. Panel a shows the effect on all hospital admissions over the life-course. Overall, the figure reveals that the average reform effect is close to zero at younger ages, but grows in magnitude and becomes significantly different from zero at older ages. This negative trend (which reflects a growing positive health effect of the reform with increasing age) is even more pronounced for men (panel c). For men, the positive health impact of the reform seems to materialize more and more with increasing age. In contrast, the figure for women (panel b) does not reveal a comparably similar and clear structure: while there are several significant reductions in hospitalization rates at older ages, there is no significant reform effect at age 35.\newline

%\subsection[The effect on main diagnosis chapters]{Results on main diagnosis chapters}
\subsection{Diagnosis Chapters}

% Main Diagnosis Chapters
What is driving the significant reductions in hospitalization rates? I exploit the detailed reporting on the main diagnosis related to each hospitalization case in the data and assess the effect of extended maternity leave on the components of hospitalizations. The dependent variables now refer to the number of specific diagnoses, grouped in 13 chapters, per 1,000 individuals.\footnote{Panel A of Table \ref{tab:outcomes_coding_main_chapters} presents an overview of the diagnosis chapters.} 
%To further examine the source for the reductions in hospitalizations, I look at the impact of the maternity leave reform on the reasons of hospitalizations. For that reason, I use the main diagnoses chapters as dependent variables.
%\footnote{Panel A of Table \ref{tab:outcomes_coding_main_chapters} gives an overview of the diagnosis chapters that generate the hospital admission variable.} 
Figure \ref{fig: DD_across_main chapters} plots DiD estimates of the policy change effect on the incidence rate per diagnosis chapter for all patients (panel a) as well as for women and men separately (panels b and c). The estimates are based on the pooled sample and a bandwidth of six months. Each panel shows next to the estimates the frequency distribution across chapters over the period from 1995 to 2014. The results in panel a (all hospitalizations, irrespective of gender) illustrate that almost all point estimates are either negative or not significantly different from zero. This implies that I can reject the hypothesis that the expansion has a detrimental effect on any long-run child health outcome (as represented by the chapters in use). Furthermore, the largest impact of the maternity leave extension can be found for mental and behavioral disorders, followed by consequences of external causes, diseases of the digestive system, and respiratory maladies. Assessing the results against the frequency of diagnoses chapters, the strong effect on mental and behavioral disorders is striking as this diagnosis chapter has a particularly high prevalence rate in this age group. When looking at effect heterogeneity across genders, the largest impact for women as well as men are in the chapter, which is diagnosed specifically frequent: for women, the largest reduction in hospitalizations is the result from fewer diagnoses of digestive diseases, whereas for males the reduction stems to a large extent from fewer diagnoses of mental and behavioral disorders. \newline
Breaking up the analysis by age group generates additional insights. Table \ref{tab: ITT_across_chapters_per_age_group_total} contains DiD estimates of the impact of the maternity leave expansion on the main diagnosis chapters (for all inpatients).\footnote{Appendix Tables \ref{tab: ITT_across_chapters_per_age_group_women} and \ref{tab: ITT_across_chapters_per_age_group_men} show the effects for women and men, respectively.} Column 1 reports the effect on the pooled sample and is equivalent to the estimates in the graphical representation. Moreover, columns 2 to 5 list the impact of the expansion on the main diagnosis chapter per age bracket. On the one hand, there are chapters that exhibit increasing health differentials the more the individuals grow older. This is especially the case for mental and behavioral disorders, which resemble the overall effects of hospital admissions. In general, mental and behavioral disorders bear the largest relative contribution in reducing hospitalizations: in the pooled sample, MBD accounts for one third of the reduction in hospitalizations, and in the last age bracket (32-35 years of age) the importance of this diagnosis chapter for the drop in hospitalizations rises to almost 50\%. On the other hand, there are also chapters, which display differentials that either fade out (disease of the digestive system and respiratory maladies), or are constant (e.g. illnesses affecting sense organs) across age groups.\footnote{Appendix Figure \ref{fig: appendix_lc_matrix_chapters} shows the respective life-course figures for each diagnosis chapter separately and extends the previous findings.}\newline 


\bigskip
% EFFECT ON MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS
\subsection{Mental \& Behavioral Disorders}
The estimated effects of the maternity leave reform on mental and behavioral disorders stand out in terms of importance for the overall effect size and its prevalence in the age group under consideration. For this reason, I present more refined evidence on this diagnosis chapter in the following. %Second, as shown in Figure \ref{fig: top5diagnosis_in_2014_across_agegroups}, MBD are the most frequent diagnosis type for individuals aged between 15 and 35 years in 2014. %Another important aspect is that MBD caused the highest costs per diagnosis among all diagnoses chapters for the age group 15-45 years in 2015.\footnote{The top three chapters with the highest costs per diagnosis (for the age group 15-45 in 2015) were: mental and behavioral disorders (9,800{\euro}), diseases of the digestive system (8,900{\euro}), and illnesses of the musculoskeletal system (4,900{\euro}).} \newline
Table \ref{tab: DD_d5_total} shows DiD estimates for the effect of the expansion in maternity leave on the diagnosis of mental and behavioral disorders for all in-patients. Analogously to the tables before, Panel A presents estimates on the pooled sample, covering the years from 1995 to 2014 (age 17-35). Panel B contains estimates when splitting the data into four age groups. The dependent variable is defined as the number of diagnoses in the chapter of mental and behavioral disorders per 1,000 individuals. The coefficient in Panel A, column 1 suggests that over the entire time frame, there are on average 0.6 fewer diagnoses of mental and behavioral disorders per 1,000 individuals. When looking at the effects per age bracket, in Panel B, one can see no significant effects for younger cohorts (17-21 and 22-26 years of age) and an increasing impact of the maternity leave expansion with children's age. Tables \ref{tab: DD_d5_female} and \ref{tab: DD_d5_male} show the effects for women and men separately. While the estimates for women are close to zero and not statistically significant from zero, the magnitude of the effects for men are large. In the pooled sample, I find an average reduction of 1.2 fewer MBD diagnoses per 1,000 individuals for men who were born after the maternity leave expansion. When considering the estimates per age bracket, one can see a similar pattern as it is with hospitalization rates. Namely, that the health differentials are opening up from the age of 27 and are further increasing towards the end of the observed time span. Figure \ref{fig: lc_d5_frg_DD} shows the corresponding life-course graphs, which confirm the impression obtained from the tables. In panel a, you can see the DiD estimates on a yearly basis for all diagnoses related to MBD. The life-course graph illustrates that at younger ages the effect of the legislation change is close to zero and insignificant. Yet, the estimates grow in magnitude and become statistically significant for older cohorts. The reduction in MBD diagnoses at older ages seem to be driven by males. Their life-course graph exhibits even more pronounced features than the corresponding one for all cases in panel a. In contrast, the differentials for women do not seem to follow a visible trend. \newline
In the next step, I investigate what are the drivers for the reduction in mental and behavioral disorders in response to the 1979 maternity leave reform. To do so, I make use of the detailed coding in the ICD classification system and investigate the effect on diseases that constitute the chapter of mental and behavioral diseases (henceforth called subdiagnoses or subcategories).\footnote{For instance, the chapter of mental and behavioral diseases have codes starting with F00-F99. In this exercise I go one level deeper and look at the effect of the reform on, for example, affective disorders, which are grouped in the codes F30-F39. Panel B of Table \ref{tab:outcomes_coding_main_chapters} defines the subcategories of the mental and behavioral diseases chapter.} Figure \ref{fig: d5partition} shows the temporal variation in the composition of mental and behavioral diseases. In 2014, the end point of the sample, the five most frequent MBD are (in descending order): mental and behavioral disorders due to the use of psychoactive substances, followed by schizophrenia, affective disorders, neuroses, and personality disorders. These five subcategories constitute more than 95\% of all mental and behavioral disorders. Figure \ref{fig: ITT_d5_subcategories} shows DiD estimates of the legislation effect and incidence rates of the subcategories of mental and behavioral disorders. The dependent variables are defined as the number of subdiagnosis per 1,000 individuals and the estimates are based on the pooled sample as well as a bandwidth of half a year around the cutoff date. In panel a, one can see that the reduction in MBD is the result of fewer diagnoses related to the use of psychoactive substances and fewer incidences of schizophrenia. When considering effect heterogeneity across sexes, one can see that the reduction is triggered by fewer diagnoses for males. Table \ref{tab: ITT_across_d5subcategories_per_age_group_total} presents results when diving the pooled sample into four age brackets.\footnote{The table considers all diagnoses concerning subcategories of MBD and does not distinguish between the sexes. Respective coefficients for women and men can be found in the Appendixtables \ref{tab: ITT_across_d5subcategories_per_age_group_women} and \ref{tab: ITT_across_d5subcategories_per_age_group_men}.} The reductions in the subcategories are experienced by the older cohorts (27-31 and 32-35 years of age) and tend to get larger with higher age.

\subsection{Robustness Tests}\label{sec: robustness}

I perform several sensitivity and placebo tests to assess the robustness of my findings. The results of these checks are reported in Table \ref{tab: robustness_hospital}. Overall, the sensitivity tests demonstrate that my main results are robust to alternative specifications and estimations, indicating that the maternity leave reform significantly reduces hospitalization rates between the ages 17 to 35, and in particular so for men.\newline

\textbf{Alternative Specifications.---}First, I test whether my results are sensitive towards an alternative specification of the \textit{dependent variable}, namely the number of diagnoses per 1,000 individuals born in a specific month-year combination. Ideally, I would like to use for the denominator the annual size of a month-of-birth cohort. This data is not available. In the main analysis, I resort to the monthly number of births per birth year as denominator, which is time-invariant. However, over time, this denominator might reflect the actual population size of a given MOB cohort only imperfectly (due to migration or death). Therefore, I construct an alternative denominator using actual annual population figures by year of birth, weighted by the relative frequency of births across birth months in that particular year of birth.\footnote{For instance, in order to get the number of people born in May 1979 who live in Germany in 2014, I use the number of people born in 1979 (observed in 2014) and weight them with the fraction $\frac{\text{births in May 1979}}{\text{births in 1979}}$.} Column 2 in Table \ref{tab: robustness_hospital} shows that my results are robust to using this alternative denominator.\footnote{The number of observations is smaller since the statistics on annual population size by birth month and year are only available since 2003.} Second, I show that the results are not sensitive towards a different \textit{level of aggregation}. For this exercise, I disaggregate my data spatially and create a regional panel for 204 labor market regions (LMR) in West Germany covering the years 2003 - 2014. Figure \ref{fig: AMR_regions_Germany} contains a map with the LMR used in the analysis. The dependent variable is defined as the number of diagnoses per 1,000 individuals, using the specification as in the preceding robustness test, but on the regional level of the LMR.\footnote{Actual population size by MOB cohort on the LMR level is approximated by data on current population by year of birth - i.e. the number of inhabitants in year $t$ who were born in 1979 in region $r$ - weighted by the relative frequency of birth across months (as given by the fertility distribution in the national vital statistics).} In order to avoid potentially confounding effects on the regional level, I include region fixed effects.\footnote{The corresponding regression specification is as follows (regions are weighted by population):\newline $\text{Y}_{mrt} =\ \gamma_0 + \gamma_1 \text{Treat}_{m} + \gamma_2 \text{After}_{m} + \gamma_3 (\text{Treat}_{m} \times \text{After}_{m}) + \psi_m + \phi_r + \rho_t + \varepsilon_{mrt} \label{eq:DD_LMR}$.} Column 3 presents estimates based on the regional panel data that are very similar to the main results. \newline


\textbf{Alternative Estimations.---}In the next step, I investigate the effect of changes in the estimation approach. First, column 4 of Table \ref{tab: robustness_hospital} reports estimates based on a \textit{triple-differences (DDD)} approach. The additional control group is comprised of individuals living on the territory of the former GDR (East Germany). The underlying idea is that children (and their mothers) born in East Germany in 1979 were not affected by the West German 1979 maternity leave reform and should consequently resemble a valid comparison group (conditional the common trend assumption). Importantly, this specification allows me netting out general time trends in the outcome variables that might affect the results. The corresponding triple-differences model is as follows:
\begin{align}
\text{Y}_{mt} =\ &\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{Treat}_{m} + \beta_2 \text{After}_{m} + \beta_3 \text{FRG}_m \nonumber\\&+ \beta_4 (\text{Treat}_{m} \times \text{After}_{m}) + \beta_5 (\text{Treat}_m \times \text{FRG}_m) + \beta_6 (\text{After}_m \times \text{FRG}_m) \nonumber\\ &+ \beta_7 (\text{Treat}_m\times \text{After}_m\times \text{FRG}_m) + \psi_m + \rho_t + \varepsilon_{mt} \label{eq:DDD}
\end{align}

which now contains an additional dummy variable $\text{FRG}_m$ (West Germany) as well as interactions of this group with the treatment cohort 1979 ($\text{Treat}_{m}$), children born in/after May ($\text{After}_{m}$) and with the interaction term $\text{Treat}_{m} \times \text{After}_{m}$. The parameter of interest is $\beta_7$, which captures the impact of the 1979 maternity leave reform on health outcomes. Once again, the general pattern of my main results remains robust to this alternative estimation. While the estimates become less precise, the point estimates increase slightly (but not significantly). Second, column 5 presents estimates based on an \textit{alternative difference-in-difference} estimation. In this case, I use the 1979 birth cohort born in East Germany as control group. In other words, I compare health outcomes of children who are born in months close the the cutoff date (May 1979) and reside in the former area of West Germany to outcomes of children born in the same months but who live in the area of the former GDR.\footnote{I use the empirical model: $\text{Y}_{mt} =\ \delta_0 + \delta_1 \text{After}_{m} + \delta_2 \text{FRG}_m + \delta_3 (\text{After}_m \times \text{FRG}_m) + \psi_m + \rho_t + \varepsilon_{mt}$.} The estimates in column 5 suggest that the results are robust to using this alternative difference-in-difference approach.\footnote{Note that I also find significant results for females in this specification, which is not in line with my baseline findings.} Third, as a further sensitivity test, I re-estimate my main regression equation including an \textit{additional control group} next to the one defined in section \ref{sec:empirical_strategy_1design}. The additional control group is comprised of children born in the months surrounding the threshold month May but two years before the reform took place (i.e. around May 1977). The advantage of including another pre-reform West German birth cohort is that it might better help to account for systematic month-of-birth patterns in hospitalization rates (due to a larger sample size). The estimates from this approach can be found in column 6. Once again, the results and pattern of my baseline results hold when adding this additional control cohort.\newline


\textbf{Placebo Tests.---}I perform two placebo tests to validate my identifying assumptions: First, I run a \textit{temporal placebo} and test whether my estimated effects are caused by children eligible to the more generous maternity leave regime and not by an underlying general time trend affecting children born post-April. For this exercise I use the two pre-reform birth cohorts 1978 and 1977, pretending that May 1, 1978 was the reform date. The estimtes from this placebo analysis can be found in column 7. Second, I run a \textit{spatial placebo} analysis and re-estimate my main DiD specification using the birth cohorts 1979 and 1978 and May 1, 1979 as reform cut-off date, but this time using the sample of East German individuals (who were not affected by the reform). Column 8 shows the estimates of this placebo analysis. Reassuringly, both placebo tests yield insignificant effects, supporting the notion that my main findings are indeed caused by the West German maternity leave reform.\newline

\textbf{Subgroup analysis: Rural and Urban Areas.---}Last, I use my regional panel on inpatient cases (as defined by the first set of robustness sets - see column 3) to assess whether the reform has a different impact on children's health in rural and urban areas. Theoretically, there are two reasons for why I might estimate a differential impact of the maternity leave reform. First, female labor force participation rates are generally higher in urban areas. Hence, it is likely that maternity leave eligibility rates in urban areas were higher than in rural areas in 1979. If that were true, I would expect my ITT estimates to be larger in urban areas. Second, apart from general differences in labor force participation rates, mothers in urban and rural areas might differ in their return to work behavior. If urban pre-reform mothers were more likely to return to the labor market faster (after 2 months of giving birth) than rural mothers, the reform impact for urban mothers would comprise a partly compensated reduction in their reduced labor supply in the first 6 months after childbirth. In contrast, if rural mothers had stayed at home in the absence of the reform anyways, the reform would have implied a windfall profit. To be clear, this argumentation is very hypothetical, since I lack information on the return-to-work behavior for mothers in urban and rural regions. This hypothesis is grounded on the observation that the rural population tends to be more traditional and conservative. Columns 9 and 10 show DiD estimates for rural and urban areas. Although the effect on males is present in both samples, the effect on all hospitalizations (irrespective of gender) is driven by urban areas only. \newline
%Third, differential reform effects in urban and rural regions might also result from differences in the available counterfactual mode of care (see Danzer et al.). 



\textbf{Mental and behavioral disorders.---}Since this diagnosis chapter plays a central role in this analysis, I run the same set of sensitivity test as I did for hospital admissions. The results can be found in Table \ref{tab: robustness_d5} in the Appendix. I find that the results are robust to the different specifications and estimation procedures.

\section{Concluding Remarks}\label{sec:conclusion}

My results show that the 1979 maternity leave reform had positive health effects as indicated by fewer hospitalizations. Importantly, some of these effects materialize only later in life. Hence, my results imply that the assessment of maternity leave, which focuses only on short-run outcomes, might miss out certain aspects that develop only in the long-run.

		\scriptsize{\emph{Notes:} The figure describes the legislative change in the length of job protection and maternity leave, which took place in the Federal Republic of Germany in 1979. The reform increased post-birth maternity leave from eight weeks to six months, while keeping the initial structure of the period from six weeks before until eight weeks after childbirth unchanged (mother protection period).\newline \textit{Source: }The figure is based on information from \cite{Dustmann2012}, \cite{DIW2002}, \cite{schonberg2014expansions} as well as \cite{zmarzlik1999mutterschutzgesetz}.}

The dark lines correspond to the treatment cohorts, whereas control units are marked by light dashed lines. Hospital admissions are defined as the sum of all diagnosis chapters listed in Panel A of Table \ref{tab:outcomes_coding_main_chapters}. This excludes diagnoses of the "O" chapter (pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium), among others that occur very infrequently. The x-axis shows in addition to the year the age of the treatment cohort in brackets.}

		\emph{Notes:} The figure plots the number of births around the cutoff date May 01 1979 for the expansion in maternity leave from two to six months after childbirth. Panel A shows the raw data, i.e. the actual number of births per day (unadjusted). Panel B, however, plots the difference between the raw and expected number of births when accounting for day of year, public holiday, and year$\times$day of week fixed effects. For the expected number of births I use data in the same time window (one month before and after the threshold) for the years 1977-1990, except for the year in which the reform took place. \newline\emph{Source:} Birth registry data from North Rhine-Westphalia and Baden-Württemberg. Taken together, both states account for almost 36\% of all births in the former Federal Republic of Germany in 1979.

\textit{"The positive impact of breastfeeding on lowering the risk of death from infectious diseases in the first two years of life is now well-established (1). A mounting body of evidence suggests that breastfeeding may also play a role in programming noncommunicable disease risk later in life (2-13) including protection against overweight and obesity in childhood (2-6)."}

\textit{"The study showed that children who received breast milk for the first four months had a specific pattern of growth and metabolic profile that differed from the formula-fed babies. Even at 15 days of life, the breast-fed infants had blood insulin levels that were lower than the formula-fed infants.\newline
By 3 years of age, many of the metabolic and growth differences between the breast-fed and formula-fed infants had disappeared. However, blood pressure readings were higher in the infants who had been fed the high-protein formula compared with breast-fed infants. The blood pressure rates were still within the normal range."}
